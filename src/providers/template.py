    ROM and save file handling
    --------------------------
    The provider does NOT need to scan, filter, or resolve ROM/save files.
    The application (game_nav_mixin.py) reads `provider.roms_dir` and
    `provider.saves_dir` via getattr() and passes them to `detect_games_with_dirs`,
    which handles all extension matching and pairing internally.

    Your only responsibility is to set `self.roms_dir` and `self.saves_dir`
    to the correct directories during __init__ or probe().
